It starts by creating a 2D table, dp, where dp[i][j] represents the maximum product that can be obtained by inserting j multiplication signs into the first i digits of the number string.\n\n    Next, the function fills up the dp table iteratively. For each cell in the table, it calculates the maximum product by considering different possible ways to insert multiplication signs.\n\n    After filling up the table, the function returns the maximum product, which is stored in dp[N][K], as the maximum product for the entire number string.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    dp = [[0 for _ in range(K+1)] for _ in range(N+1)]\n\n    for i in range(1, N+1):\n        for j in range(K+1):\n            dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] * int(num_str[i-1])\n            for k in range(1, j+1):\n                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j-k] * int(num_str[i-1]))\n\n    return dp[N][K]\ndef test_max_product():\n    # Test case 1\n    num_str1 = \"123\"\n    N1 = 3\n    K1 = 1\n    expected_result1 = 36  # Corrected expected result: 1*23 = 23 or 12*3 = 36, max is 36\n    assert max_product(num_str1, N1,\n                       K1) == expected_result1, f\"Test case 1 failed.
