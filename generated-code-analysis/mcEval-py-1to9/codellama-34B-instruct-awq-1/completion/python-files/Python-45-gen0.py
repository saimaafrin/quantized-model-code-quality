def minimum_cost_to_merge_fruits(fruit_counts: List[int]) -> int:
    """
    Calculates the minimum total cost to merge multiple heaps of fruits into a single heap.
    The cost of merging two heaps is equal to the sum of their weights. The function utilizes
    a greedy algorithm with a min-heap (priority queue) to ensure the smallest heaps are merged first,
    minimizing the total cost.

    Parameters:
    fruit_counts (List[int]): A list of integers representing the counts of each type of fruit.

    Returns:
    int: The minimum total cost required to merge all heaps of fruits.

    Examples:
    >>> minimum_cost_to_merge_fruits([1, 2, 9])
    15
    >>> minimum_cost_to_merge_fruits([10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
    300 .
